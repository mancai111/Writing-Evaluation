"This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones"").

"Students would be unaware of the topics related to the course they are going into, for they have not studied it yet.

A teacher could use this project as a precursor to the unit they will study first, beginning to teach right when they get back to school.

"Teachers can give an insight on what their class will be like because teachers can create projects that focus on different types of writing styles. For example, teachers can prepare students to write persuasive essays such as why people should go to the beach over the summer or go to a historic place because they will allow students to work on their persuasion skills and how to organize their essay. In addition, teachers can also give students an outlook on what their class will be like because teachers can have students review over math skills that might be used in other lessons. An example of this is a student who is taking Pre-Calculus in the upcoming school year can review over tangent, sine, and cosine from geometry to make sure that they have the basic fundamentals of geometry covered to be successful. Teachers can also help students to gain experience of what the class will be like because teachers can give students a preview of how challenging a course may be.

Another insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with even-numbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with odd-numbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.

" During the summer if a student is not of the age to have a job then they are traveling with family or doing nothing. It would be easier for them to fill that free time up with a project that they can design and create. The first part of the planning process for a project would be for students to pick a specific topic within that subject and stick with it. After finding the topic the student is willing to talk about, it would help them to create a rough draft of what the actual project will look like once everything is complete. After planning carefully planning everything, they can start their projects once they get ready. Sometimes when it comes to students doing projects, they never tend to start the same day as when they plan. With the projects being student designed they can start when they feel its best and get quality work done in a small amount of time. Some people like to section their projects off and work on it piece by piece to keep it neat and organized. Others place thing in every position to get a good feeling of how their final project will turnout. Finally, after some time the student would be close to finishing the final project. Once they have reached this step, all that is left would be for them to make sure it looks presentable and to study the information. Since this is a summer project it would be a good idea for the student to know the information just in case the following teacher ask them to present it. Adding any final detail would be the very last thing the student would have to do before they are finished and waiting to turn it in once school starts.",4,if a student is not of the age to have a job it would be easier for them to fill that free time up with

"This is possible because a teacher, when designing the year's lesson plan, will incorporate the summer assignments into it, usually using it as a segway into the year's curriculum. When students design their summer assignments, however, they will likely focus on different subjects picking a topic they're interested in rather than one that will lay the ground work for the upcoming year. This will result in the teachers having to spend extra time at the beginning of the year introducing certain topics and skills that should have been developed over the summer. In turn, this will cause teachers to rush towards the end of the year in attempts to cram all remaining information into their lessons, resulting in many areas being skipped over or barely taught.",4,"when students design their summer assignments, they will likely focus on different subjects picking a topic they're interested in . this will result in"

The book review project requires identifying the author's argument and tone which helps students develop the skills required for the analytic essay component of the A.P. Language and Composition exam. Teacher-designed projects expose students to a strict interpretation which allow students to extrapolate the necessary ideas and disregard the trivial details. They are not intensive to complete because their primary function is to spark interest with students and are merely a precursor to the course. Although they may abide by the topics of a course, they fail to prepare students for the challenges of the course.

"Giving students the option to have distance learning could be extremely beneficial to not just the individuals who decide to try it, but it can also be beneficial for those who feel they need the in person experience with a teacher. It is an understandable assumption that when left to their own devices students will just quit learning all together, but this is not frequently the case. During many arguments where school systems are being called into question or policies are being added the opposition makes the argument that the change will cause an overall decrease of productivity rather than an increase. Though this may be because people are prone to opposing change so just like giving students individual computers has worked in many school systems, the option of distance learning may one day prove to improve more than it damages. However, the only way to truly see if distance learning works or not is to actually implement it in schools, even for just a year, to assess the data and decide whether or not it should be continued.",6,distance learning can be beneficial for those who feel they need in person experience . the only way to truly see if distance learning works is to

Making school projects student-designed will set up students for success because they have that prior knowledge to build off. When students retain information from the previous year, it gives them confidence when tackling new concepts. Schools try their best to give students confidence so they can perform to the best of their abilities. Their confidence can be damaged when they don't remember concepts from the previous year which goes into learning new subjects. This hinders their ability to succeed in school. Making summer projects student-designed will help them remember past concepts, which will increase student confidence during the school year.

"Such as, English 10 students were expected to come up with comprehension questions for a book, and they ended up creating questions that were easy to them, but very difficult for other students. Students would not know how to create assessments that would cater to everyone's level of knowledge. Since teachers oversee the class, they would know what kinds of questions to create that would best fit for the class's knowledge, with no bias. If there was student bias involved in designing a project, many other students will have complaints and disagree with the components of the project. For example, a history teacher who assigned a project did not receive a single complaint compared to when a student proposed a project. If students know that the project was designed by the teacher, it will significantly decrease the amount of complaints and the students would just accept it because he is a higher authority. By having the teacher design the project, students will all have a fair assignment to do with no bias since it was designed by the teacher.

"There is summer break for a reason, and that is it is much needed as a school year is long, draining, and full of ups and downs. Summer break should be a time of fun, relaxation, and vacations, and for many, may include other tasks such as sports and summer jobs. A summer project can take away from these things, especially if it is teacher-designed. Many students even feel burdened by the idea of knowing it has to be done, and therefore causes them to stress about it. If the project was student-designed, however, the taking away of summer time would be shrunken to a minimum. This is because the students can do a project that fits their location, amount of time, and interests. A student may not be able to fulfill a teacher-designed experiment, because they simply do not have time to do so. For example, a student who vacations a lot during the summer, may not be able to do a teacher-designed experiment which involves measuring plant growth over time, which requires a lot of time, and may only produce valid results if they were grown in one location. To do this, the student may have to cancel a trip, which should never have to happen. If the project were student-designed however, the student could do an experiment based off of their travels, perhaps collecting and comparing data from the places they travel. Not only would this be interesting and unique, it would also be very knowledgeable, and most importantly not impede in the way of the trips the student takes. In the end, summer projects should be student-designed, because it would not take away as much from the students' summer as it would if it were teacher-designed.",4,"summer break should be a time of fun, relaxation, and vacations . many students feel burdened by the idea of knowing it"

In Beijing, China it is said to be so polluted due to tailpipe emmisions that one would get sick if they were to go outside without a mask on to stop from breathing in the chemicals. In Paris, France the airborne toxins reached to a level just under the amount of chemicals in the air of Beijing. The city officials of Paris had to ban use of automobiles for about a week to rid the air of the poisons. If caught, vialotors were fined 22 euros (31 dollars American). This worked suprisingly well, and since the air cleared up, peoplpe are allowed to use their cars again. The Vauban in Germany is a neighborhood that has made it extremely difficult to own a vehicle.

"Seeing that most summer projects are teacher-designed, it makes the students dread doing their summer work and procrastinate doing the work until the last minute. A way to prevent this is to let students decide what project they want to do, as long as it's creative and helped them learn something over the summer. Doing this can help students think of ideas quickly, which will make the process of starting and finishing the project at a quicker pace. This will prevent less stress and procrastination for students because there are no specific guidelines that are the same for every student, as long as there is a specific due date for the project.

"Teachers are always trying to help their students out in any way possible, they would never assign something in which students are bound to fail in. At times when students are given the choice to choose their project, a majority vote is taken just so the whole class is working on the same topic. A lot of the times, what I've experience is that students agree to things just because their classmates want to do it, in the fear that their friends and classmates will go against them. This way some students don't feel comfortable doing the project because they know it'll be hard for them. When teachers design our projects they keep in mind how every student will attempt the project and this way all the students are able to complete the project without having a hard time. When ever my teacher left it up to me to pick a project I would have a hard time choosing one because I wouldn't know how it'll turn our or will I have a hard time completing it half way through.

In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars: ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Chicago Tribune). To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically.

"For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or not enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.

"About a year ago, I went to a two-week engineering summer camp at a college I am interested in attending. There were students there from tenth through twelfth grade from all over the state, and the camp itself was actually run by a group of college students and a few professors. Over the course of the camp we learned all about engineering and future career fields we may be interested in, but we also were given an assignment. We had to design models of an Earth themed school in groups with the materials they provided before the end of the camp. To be honest, I had expected that we would have to take a test or fill out some questionnaire on what we had learned, given that we were at a college, so this was a nice surprise. Turns out that it was in fact the college students, and not the professors, who were in charge coming up with this project. Since they were not much older than us, they knew how to get us to apply the knowledge that we had learned in a way that we would enjoy. If all projects were done like this, I'm sure many of them would be of much higher quality than a teacher-designed project.

"Nowadays, many students do not like being forced to do assignments or projects that they have no interest in. It can cause them to lose focus and do poorly on the project/assignment. To have the ability to implement their own ideas and thoughts into a project would be way more efficient than a project where the students get little to no creative freedom. For example, if a student is extremely interested in music, they can use what they are passionate about and create a song for his/her summer project. This project will enhance the student's knowledge on music and let them have a chance to build their skills while having a good time. Since it is also something they like to do, the student will put more effort into it unlike a teacher-designed project where they will be less motivated to do a good job. Moreover, for students who do not usually explore their creative side, the student-designed project will be a great opportunity for them to be able to improve in that area. So through research and their own abilities, many students will learn new things about themselves that they did not know before. Overall, creativity is key to good projects and with student-designed projects comes creative freedom, which interests students way more than a normal project would.

We both still chose to do it and took a risk, in the end most of the goldfish died during the experiment and our research assignment didn't went that well as we thought it would be. Me and my partner didn't receive a good grade, we got a B- on the research project. After that I decided to always choose a topic that has been assigned by the teacher because they already been more experienced and chose what is easy for us to do. This year research assignment is assigned by our teacher and it is much more easier for us to do as it is assigned by the teacher and until now we have been getting good grades and just waiting for the final part to complete. It is better to always listen to your teachers point of view because it might help you in the future and you might end with a good grade, even you get your teacher's guidance for the project.

"Like stated in the paragraph above, if a student got to work on an assignment they were passionate about, then their work ethic would be better than if they were not passionate about their assignment. If the student was not passionate then their only motivation would be to finish the assignment, not to explore their interests. The motive relies on how passionate the student is about their topic; and if he or she is interested in what they are writing about, then it is most likely they will create a better product in general and also have a fun time learning about it. This same concept applies to more than just school and can apply to many other subjects such as, for example, a job. While many people would rather work in a job that made them happy, a lot of them work in places that employees might not necessarily enjoy. As a result, their passion and motivation for their work goes down, which eventually leads to a lower work ethic which then results in a bad product. They would rather just work on it to get it done instead of actually enjoying their work and being passionate about the subject. In the end, it is better if the student were assigned a project where they were free to investigate their own topic and create a project based on that.",4,many people would rather work in a job that made them happy . but a lot of them work in places that employees might not enjoy

While there are positive advantages to these moble transportations, there are also negative portions that cars have. You may be awfully suprised what these transports can do outside their good nature. For instance, cars run on fossil fuel, which is a artifical gas that ruins the enviorment as much as people cutting down trees and smoke coming out of nuclear plants that do damage to the clouds in the sky. Cars don't just hurt the enviorment, they hurt innocent lives as well. Let me pull out an example: Person A and Person C are driving on the interstate when Person B spills out too much fossil fuel from the exaust pipe of his car.

This might be a good way to teach them the general idea of what soccer is but they will never be able to learn the skills that are necessary in the game. That child will never learn how to pass, shoot, kick, or even have the social skills to communicate with his team mates. This goes the same for any other activity. The teachers in this school are treating there students just like this child. If they just give them the summer project and tell them to complete it they will never learn the skills of self-management and creativity that they would develop while design their own summer projects.

"Last summer my friend Generic_Name was very busy as she had a leadership role at a summer camp for two weeks, she camped for a week, and she had volleyball practice everyday in August. As the first day of school was approaching Generic_Name realized that she still had to read a book and answer questions on it for school. Many students, just like Generic_Name, have very busy summers and often have trouble finding time to complete those boring teacher-designed projects. If summer projects were student designed, students could create a project that fit into their schedule rather than long projects that took away from their time to themselves. Another example showing that summer projects should be student designed is my cousin Generic_Name. Generic_Name lives in California and last year her school started a new initiative where they left summer projects in the hands of the students. The students designed a project where everyone had to create a presentation showing what they did over the summer and how those activities impacted them. With this project, Generic_Name didn't have to go out of her way to complete it as she just had to take photos and journal about the many things she was doing over the summer, which made this project fun and easy for her. The students at her high school created this project as they knew it wouldn't take away from the students time to relax, go on vacation, and hangout with their friends and families. In the past, Generic_Name would never complete her projects as she simply didn't have the time to do it because the teachers were assigning reading projects with long packet that analyzed the assigned book. Overall, students brains will be better stimulated over the summer if their projects are student-designed because they will be more motivate to find time to complete the projects.

"Most teacher designed projects rely on specific structures and check list drawn up by the teacher for the students to fallow. They do no prompt the students to: think, learn, ponder, and reflect, rather they give students a list of mundane tasks to complete and check off.

Giving a student a complex prompt or problem and allowing them to design the project themselves in order to answer it, stimulates the brain far more than handing the student an assignment where the answers have already been neatly planed and laid out by the teacher. For a better education students need to be able to solve problems on their own and chart their own waters, they will never grow if they are always defendant on a teacher to tell them what to do and how to do it.

"Overall I believe Summer projects should be designed by students, summer for students is their time to relax and have fun, but when a teacher assigns a summer assignment students most likely do not do it or keep procrastinating and pushing it back. If the students make it themselves and make it beneficial and fun they will take time out of their day to do it. That's why it's important for teachers to understand how students function, they won't respond to boring assignments, you have to make something that students are actually interested in learning. If you are unable to do that let the students make it themselves. When students design their own projects they know what they want and what they are interested in to learn.

In conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Drivers should stop trying to multitask everything and do everything at once and just pay attention to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one selfish person decides to not pay attention and drive around clueless then everyone else suffers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to still put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences getting caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all multitasking while driving by using your phone only shows impatience and immaturity. Texting and driving has cause six times more deaths than drunk driving yet people still shrug it off due to them thinking they can manage to keep their attention in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their time on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a notification immediately and wait and do it when the time is right.            ,6,drivers should stop trying to multitask and do everything at once . texting and driving has caused six times more deaths than drunk driving .

The number of miles driven by Americans peaked in 2005, and has been diminishing steadily after that. Due to the recession, the majority of Americans couldn't afford to buy new cars, meaning that less people were driving.

Now some people may like watching meadowlarks in a corn field, but if a group of students who played cricket could choose their own project they would choose the average number of pegs caught in a single game. Cricket is definitely an interesting sport to play and watch , so while grading the project the teacher could discover that some students in the school enjoy cricket and the teacher could start a cricket club.

"By telling their students exactly what to do for a summer project, teachers may be making it easier for the student in the short term.

"A greater range of creativity would encite students to finish their projects faster if they were given a wider range of mediums to work with instead of just paper and pencil, or a computer program. Even when it's not over the summer, being assigned a project where I can make a poster or create a diorama instead of writing a paper is already much more exciting to me because I'm given a bunch of different mediums to work with. I personally prefer creating something big and artsy to sitting down and churning out a paper within a set time frame. The process of creating something huge feel much more satisfying because I can visibly see when I am done. Completing a paper still has a feeling of satisfaction but the overall feeling is dulled because no creativity was released. A greater range of creativity also allows for a much more interesting presentation. A differentation of styles in projects makes the overall project much more interesting and increases the chances of students paying attention for longer during those presentations.

A typical power point presentation a high school teacher assigns has basic requirements: a specific number of slides, easily-applicable pictures, and bullet point information. However, when given the chance, students embraced their creativity outside the classroom environment and created sideshows, music videos, and drawings that still portrayed the same important idea any basic power point would for the assignment. As a result, the students who got lower scores on previous power points, increased their grade tremendously.

By having the teachers design the projects the students will learn all the materials needed for the next year as well as learn new materials that will be introduced.

It also insures that the students will actually learn something through the summer rather than sitting at home forgetting everything they had just learned. Another reason for the teachers to be in favor of designing the project would be that different subjects have different requirement.

"Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semi-trucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashes/accidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.",4,"on average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week . resources have dwindled since the"

"t is important to have free time with friends and family so students maintain a social life. Social lives are important because humans are social creatures and tend to not do well without interactions. This social life is often difficult to keep up with when a student is locked up in their room doing these consuming projects and assignments that do not even help them. Family time is also being limited by these assignments. Sometimes the only time a student can see their family is during the summer. Take for instance divorced parents who only get to see their child every once and a while and one of those times being summer. Also, priorities such as jobs can be jeopardized. Students a lot of the times have full time jobs over the summer that require a lot of their time. Thus, they will not always have time to do their work. However, if these students were to make their own projects they can account for their schedule. Consequentially, having this social freedom helps with students mentally.

"A student completes assignments; rarely does one design one. In designing an assignment, one looks at the course as a whole and pick specifics to create questions around. Students, however, do not have the experience in creating questions with proper language, and it is rare that a student designs a summer assignment and can ask questions the same way that a teacher would. In CS Research class, we are asked to create questions before we learn content. In concept, this works out well, since we answer our own questions as we learn the unit. The flaw in this lies in the students not knowing what the teacher wants us to ask about. The inability to create questions regarding a topic that one hasn't learned yet is a main reason why that class has a low average grade. This conclusion can be further extrapolated and applied to summer assignments. The incapability to create questions leads to failure to create a fundamental foundation of the course content.

Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student.

" When students design the projects they think of what their classmates find interesting and it can be easier for them because they are students themselves. In other words, because they are students themselves, they know which projects to assign because they will find them interesting. Sometimes when teachers design projects they think it's interesting when they're actually not. In order to make sure they are fun, it's best to have students design the projects. When students are on break they don't want to learn from a packet of worksheets, they want to learn from fun experiments and activities. One time, my teacher designed a summer project and she thought it was an exciting experiment, but she didn't realize that the experiment was actually really long and complicated for the students.

"In many schools today creativity is not often emphasised, although this is true, the real-world strives for creativity, and not allowing the students grow as people by exploring topics that interest them and letting them create things would be a disservice to not only them, but society as a whole. For example, many students nowadays spend more time searching for the answers online to the excessive amount of dreadfully bland work assigned to them, then they do in actually completing the assignment themselves. another example would be that many students have a capacity for creativity and that the world will only progress as long as the future people who will run it are creative, and have the ability to think outside the box, for a few this skill comes naturally, but for many it is learned. Schools need prepare the youth of today for the future that is quickly approaching, there are many problems that must be fixed and can only be fixed by creative thinkers. Everything a person does, their actions, their thoughts, their speech, is all derived from the classroom; With that in mind, the importance of a student designed assignment (although miniscule) is detrimental to the future successes of society.

"In the city of Vauban, Germany there is a suburb that was finished around 2006. Its goal was to limit the use of cars. So far it seems successful in its purpose; where 70% of the families living there do not have cars, and at least 57% sold a car to live in that suburb. For the most part, there is no driveways, garages, or street parking so it is mainly car-free except for the ""main thoroughfare"" being the tram to downtown. Proof that not only the idea was beneficial, but it was also ""inspirational"" is that places like Vauban, are growing more and more in Europe, and the U.S. has the EPA (Evironmental Protection Agency) promoting these car reduced communities, and legislators are now starting to act upon it.

Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says ""all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"".

"For example, before this school year started several friends of mine were gonna take AP US History, which they had received a summer project for the class. Their was summer was okay until about a week before school started. That's when they realized they should've started weeks ago as the project was a packet with several pages of questions. Frantically and desperately they began their summer assignment, and well they may have lost some sleep due to staying up late but they ended up finishing. Although, my best friend had it the worse since she began her day with morning conditioning, followed by her going to work, and lastly afternoon practice and the stress from the summer project did't help. AP teacher-designed projects are lengthy and extra, which is why one should prefer student-designed projects.

"In Paris, France a partial driving ban was put into effect just before the 'City of Love and Romance' reached record breaking pollution levels. The ban states that: ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following days.""(""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer). However, just because there is a law put into affect does not mean that everyone will abide by it. According to Reuters, an international news agency in London, almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their vehicles impounded because of their reaction to the fines. It is a shame that people are so unwilling to follow one rule for one day which would help the planet and reduce the pollution in their city. According to Duffer, Paris ,typically, has more smog than other European capitals. When Duffer's article was published he states, ""Last week Paris has 147 micrograms of particulate matter(PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Also, in Paris, diesel fuel is used more than gasoline. Diesel engines take more energy to burn the gas which causes more pollution than just normal gasoline. According to Reuters, France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In France, as a whole, 67 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. In the rest of Western Europe, about 53 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. The smog that is in the air from the burning gas of your vehicle ends up in your lungs. Imgine just sitting in front of the exhaust pipe of your car for a few seconds(do not actually attempt this analogy) it is overwhelming and unbearable. It is harmful to your lungs and the rest of your body. That pollution is coming out of thousands and thousands of other cars and is adding up to the air all around you. You breath that air every day, just like your family and friends as well. In Paris, after the partial driving ban, on Monday the smog cleared up enough for the French party to take away the ban on the odd-numbered plates on Tuesday, according to Duffer.

"When given a task you do not enjoy, most people do either of two things. The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work. Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student.",4,"many students push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work . sally kohn: when given the liberty to decide"

Next, teamwork is not only seen in school, but also seen in the workplace. As adults, knowing how to work together and have good communication skills with others can make ones work atmosphere more enjoyable. For example: doctors have to work together everyday to save others through sharing their knowledge and conversing with one another. Lastly, teamwork can create a decrease in social anxiety and an increase in social skills. Many students experience social anxiety while meeting new people and having conversations with others.

"After suffering through days of near-record pollution, Paris, France had composed a temporary driving ban in an attempt to clear the air, according to Rober Duffner in ""Paris Bans Driving due to Smog"". The passage goes further to explain that the ban followed five days of smog that rivalled the likes of Beijing, China, which is widely recognized for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Exceptions to the ban were made for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passengers, and public transportation was made to be free. Once the smog cleared enough, the ban was lifted and citizens were allowed back to the road, but the reduction of auto usage was what saved the air from becoming overly polluted. Moreover, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in a car-free day, entitled Day Without Cars, once a year to reduce smog in the cities, according to ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. Violators are charged with $25 fines, but, according to Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus, the people participate, and the turnouts are large. This day without cars, which has begun to spread to other Colombian cities, is a fantastic way to reduce both air pollution and stress, and is a part of a campaign to oversee the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which, according to Mayor Mockus, is the most of any city in Latin America.

"For example, if a driver is going at a rate of 55 mph and decides to check a text message, in 5 seconds they can drive the length of a football field before regaining focus on the road (Marino, 2012, p1).

With new technology development, newer cars are now equipped with hands free Bluetooth. In my opinion, car manufactures should continue innovate and develop operational equipment in cars to make the danger factor of talking on the phone while driving non-existent. Lastly, multi-tasking is a distraction that most of the time goes unnoticed. From putting on makeup, eating fast food, to searching for items in the car, these are daily tasks we do in the car without thinking about it.

Because of excessive amounts of smog in air in Paris, they came up with a clever system to reduce the amounts. An alternate day schedule is what was put in place, allowing motorists with even numbered license plates to drive one day, and odd-numbered drivers the next. Failure to leave their cars at home on the days that don't apply to them resulted in a 22-euro fine, which didn't stop some drivers.

"Many people use their phones while driving when they're with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so..In another blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it says,""Not only does texting and driving put your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Speaking of pedestrians, you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road? Well, you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap."" This piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other people's wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street. It also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if you're willing to put them in such grave danger in that case. Another good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that says,""Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving. According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks."" This article makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can affect someone's mindset. It also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be better drivers.

"A student who expects student autonomy in an advanced class with a lot of content may be fustrated and even resentful towards a teacher who tries to implement teacher-designed projects during the school year. Thus, students may not be disciplined enough to listen to their teachers and do what is expect of them if they have such a different mode of learning during the school year. Furthermore, it is especially important students understand and get used to the rigor of advanced classes such as Duel Enrollment and Advanced Placement classes, which put high demands on the students from the beginning to the end of a year. Difficult classes, like Advanced Placement, are often required to give out several tests and projects of a specific regulation or design, as per the exam that students are expected to take at the end of the year.

My friend's experience also proves that student-designed projects are the way to go. In the summer of 2019 my friend Generic_Name was given an Algebra 2 summer project packet to complete. Knowing that math isn't her strong suit she still attempted the summer assignment. As she went along the packet the questions were getting harder and harder for her to complete. She had never seen questions like this before so she got discouraged. Out of 100 math questions she only completed 10. She was beaten.

"In conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.

Drivers should stop trying to mulBtask everything and do everything at once and just pay aWenBon to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one sel? sh person decides to not pay aWenBon and drive around clueless then everyone else su? ers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to sBll put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences gegng caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all mulBtasking while driving by using your phone only shows impaBence and immaturity. TexBng and driving has caused six Bmes more deaths than drunk driving yet people sBll shrug it o? due to them thinking they can manage to keep their aWenBon in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their Bme on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a noB?caBon immediately and wait and do it when the Bme is right.
